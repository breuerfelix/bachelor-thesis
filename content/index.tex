- If your work is based on preliminary work, then outline this preliminary work: "The de-ployment into production is itself semi-automatic. In a continuous integration pipeline..."
- Do some research forrelated work, e.g., commercial products, research prototypes or con-ceptual research that have the same or similar objectives like your work. Compare and de-lineate your work with/from the related work.
- Keep an eye on the proper citation of the works you are describing
- Conclude this chapter with some insufficiencies or shortcomings of the preliminary or related work. This should motivate the necessity of your work.

- Again, summarize your work. This time you can assume that reader have read the rest of the document, i.e., you are free to use even domain-specific terms.
- In case of a master thesis in "Technische Informatik", you will have to provide an addi-tional "technical report" in English of 4-8 pages (cf. examination regulation document, §28, 1d). It is okay for me if you use this technical report as the summary here.
- Usually, during your project or thesis new and extended questions arise that are not dealt with in your project or thesis due effort reasons. Please delineate these in the outlook.
