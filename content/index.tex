\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Company}
"Inovex is an IT project centre driven by innovation and quality, focusing its services on "Digital Transformation". The main three subdivisions are "Application Development", "Data Management \& Analytics" and "IT Engineering \& Operations" in which I work in the scope of this project.\\
"IT Engineering and Operations" handles the combined disciplines required for the flexible, reliable operation of systems in data centres: the design, installation and configuration of server infrastructures, and the daily maintenance and running of these systems. The focus is on high availability and scalability, migrations, the cloud, and open-source data centre management."\cite{inovex}

\subsubsection{Philosophy}
"Here at inovex, we are using an iterative strategy process to manage our own agile transformation. We also believe in flat hierarchies, and we base all our decisions on agile values.\\
As all our project teams are self-organised and agile skills are, therefore, essential, every new inovex employee receives training in agile methods. We also support our employees by holding meetings in agile formats (like Lean Coffee) and by facilitating the internal transfer of knowledge (through brown bag lunches and tech days, for example).\\
Many of our internal teams work agilely and thus enjoy a high level of transparency, quality and efficiency. Our Marketing Team, HR Team and Sales Team have each established different agile methods tailored specifically to their requirements and they use these in combination with our ISO-certified quality management processes."\cite{inovex}

Minio is a third-party object storage. It can either be used to serve uploaded content on its own or to proxy requests to Amazon S3 compatible cloud providers. All other services are mender application logic web services.
