Envoy Internals Deep Dive - Matt Klein, Lyft (Advanced Skill Level) Envoy (https://www.envoyproxy.io\slash ) is a high performance L4/L7 network proxy with a pluggable filter chain model; this allows Envoy to be used for a variety of different scenarios, including HTTP/2, gRPC, MongoDB, and Redis. Envoy provides advanced load balancing support, including eventually consistent service discovery, circuit breakers, retries, rate limiting, and zone-aware load balancing. Envoy also has best-in-class observability, using statistics, logging, and distributed tracing. Since becoming OSS in 2016, Envoy has gained substantial traction in both "service mesh" and edge (API gateway) deployments. In this talk, Matt Klein will dive deep into Envoy internals from a systems perspective, covering threading model, stats, hot restart, the xDS APIs, and other core concepts. This is an advanced talk and prior knowledge of what Envoy is at a high level is assumed. About Matt Matt Klein is a software engineer at Lyft and the architect of Envoy. Matt has been working on operating systems, virtualization, distributed systems, networking, and making systems easy to operate for over 15 years across a variety of companies. Some highlights include leading the development of Twitter’s C++ L7 edge proxy and working on high-performance computing and networking in Amazon’s EC2. Join us for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona May 20 - 23, Shanghai June 24 - 26, and San Diego November 18 - 21!  Learn more at https://kubecon.io\mbox.

Prior knowledge of working with IoT devices is essential. What You Will Learn Understand how MQTTv3.1 and v3.1.1 works in detail Install and secure a Mosquitto MQTT broker by following best practices Design and develop IoT solutions combined with mobile and web apps that use MQTT messages to communicate Explore the features included in MQTT for IoT and Machine-to-Machine communications Publish and receive MQTT messages with Python, Java, Swift, JavaScript, and Node.js Implement the security best practices while setting up the MQTT Mosquitto broker In Detail This step-by-step guide will help you gain a deep understanding of the lightweight MQTT protocol. We'll begin with the specific vocabulary of MQTT and its working modes, followed by installing a Mosquitto MQTT broker. Then, you will use best practices to secure the MQTT Mosquitto broker to ensure that only authorized clients are able to publish and receive messages. Once you have secured the broker with the appropriate configuration, you will develop a solution that controls a drone with Python. Further on, you will use Python on a Raspberry Pi 3 board to process commands and Python on Intel Boards (Joule, Edison and Galileo). You will then connect to the MQTT broker, subscribe to topics, send messages, and receive messages in Python. You will also develop a solution that interacts with sensors in Java by working with MQTT messages. Moving forward, you will work with an asynchronous API with callbacks to make the sensors interact with MQTT messages. Following the same process, you will develop an iOS app with Swift 3, build a website that uses WebSockets to connect to the MQTT broker, and control home automation devices with HTML5, JavaScript code, Node.js and MQTT messages Style and approach This step-by-step guide describes the MQTT protocol for your IoT projects Downloading the example code for ...},

It's now more important than ever to understand how hardware components interact with the internet to collect and analyze user data. The Internet of Things (IoT), combined with the popular open source language Python, can be used to build powerful and intelligent IoT systems with intuitive interfaces. This book consists of three parts, with the first focusing on the "Internet" component of IoT. You'll get to grips with end-to-end IoT app development to control an LED over the internet, before learning how to build RESTful APIs, WebSocket APIs, and MQTT services in Python. The second part delves into the fundamentals behind electronics and GPIO interfacing. As you progress to the last part, you'll focus on the "Things" aspect of IoT, where you will learn how to connect and control a range of electronic sensors and actuators using Python. You'll also explore a variety of topics, such as motor control, ultrasonic sensors, and temperature measurement. Finally, you'll get up to speed with advanced IoT programming techniques in Python, integrate with IoT visualization and automation platforms, and build a comprehensive IoT project. By the end of this book, you'll be well-versed with IoT development and have the knowledge you need to build sophisticated IoT systems using Python. What you will learn Understand electronic interfacing with Raspberry Pi from scratch Gain knowledge of building sensor and actuator electronic circuits Structure your code in Python using Async IO, pub/sub models, and more Automate real-world IoT projects using sensor and actuator integration Integrate electronics with ThingSpeak and IFTTT to enable automation Build and use RESTful APIs, WebSockets, and MQTT with sensors and actuators Set up a Raspberry Pi and Python development environment for IoT projects Who this book is for This IoT Python book is for application developers, IoT professionals, or anyone interested in building IoT applications using t...},
